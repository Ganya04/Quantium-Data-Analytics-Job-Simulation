Certificate
Successfully completed the **Quantium-Data-Analytics-Job-Simulation Virtual Internship ([https://link-to-your-certificate.com](https://forage-uploads-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/completion-certificates/32A6DqtsbF7LbKdcq/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv_32A6DqtsbF7LbKdcq_SQGDnrwM5WzFRzJXZ_1731011760094_completion_certificate.pdf))  ** program, showcasing skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling to deliver actionable business insights.

The simulation comprised three tasks:  
1. **Task 1**: Data preparation and customer analytics.  
2. **Task 2**: Experimentation and uplift testing.  
3. **Task 3**: Analytics and commercial application.

### **Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics**  
Objective: Analyze transaction data to uncover customer purchasing behaviors and provide actionable commercial insights.

**Key Activities:**  
- Cleaned transaction and customer data for accurate analysis.  
- Segmented customers to evaluate their contribution to chip sales.  
- Investigated the driving factors behind these contributions.  
- Conducted product category analysis to identify preferences of key customer segments.

---

### **Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing**  
Objective: Extend the analysis to assess the impact of an experimental store layout on performance.

**Key Activities:**  
- Cleaned and prepared transaction and customer data.  
- Identified control stores with performance metrics similar to trial stores before implementing the new layout.  
- Conducted comparative analysis between trial and control stores to evaluate the experimental layout's effect.

---

### **Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application**  
Objective: Present insights from Tasks 1 and 2 in a client-facing presentation to guide business decisions.

### **Key Insights**  

#### **Task 1 Insights**  
- **Top 3 Customer Segments Responsible for Sales:**  
  1. **Budget Older Families**: Driven by the number of chips purchased per customer.  
  2. **Mainstream Retirees**: Sales driven by the number of customers.  
  3. **Mainstream Young Singles and Couples**: Similar to retirees, driven by customer volume.

#### **Task 2 Insights**  
- **Control and Trial Stores**:  
  - Trial Stores: 77, 86, 88.  
  - Control Stores: 233, 155, 237.  

- **Experimental Layout Results**:  
  - Stores 77 and 88 showed improved performance due to the experimental layout.  
  - Store 86 did not exhibit the same positive impact.

### Summary  
The simulation provided practical experience in:  
- Data cleaning and preparation.  
- Customer segmentation and behavior analysis.  
- Experiment design and uplift testing.  
- Presenting actionable insights through a commercial lens.  

This project showcases my ability to translate complex datasets into meaningful recommendations for business growth and decision-making.
